## Architecture

The app follows a clean architecture pattern with MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design:

## Core Components

- MovieModel: The main data model representing a movie
- MovieDTO: Data Transfer Object for API responses from TMDB
- MovieViewModel: Handles business logic and state management
- OfflineMovieService: Handles offline caching and persistence operations
- RealmMovieRepository: Manages local database operations using Realm
- FilterController: UI component for movie category filtering
- RadioButton: Custom UI component for filter selection


## Features in Detail

# 📱 User Interface
• Movie List: Displays movies in a clean table view with poster images
• Search: Real-time search with debounced input
• Filtering: Bottom sheet with radio button selection for sorting
• Loading States: Activity indicators for initial load and pagination
• Error Handling: User-friendly alerts with retry options

🌐 Network Layer
• API Integration: TMDB API endpoints for popular, revenue, and top voted movies
• Pagination: Automatic loading of additional pages as user scrolls
• Network Monitoring: Detects connectivity changes and switches to offline mode

💾 Offline Support
• Automatic Caching: Movies are cached locally for offline viewing
• Offline Mode: Seamless switching between online and offline content
• Background Caching: Efficient async operations for data persistence

## Project Structure Usage

1. Browse Movies: Launch the app to view a collection of popular movies
2. Search Movies: Use the search bar to find movies by title
3. Apply Filters: Tap the filter button to sort by Popular, Revenue, or Top Voted
4. Load More: Scroll down to automatically load more movies
5. View Details: Tap on any movie to see full details
6. Offline Mode: Previously viewed movies are available offline

## API Endpoints

The app uses the following TMDB API filter keys:
• popularity.desc - Sort by popularity (descending)
• revenue.desc - Sort by revenue (descending)
• vote_count.desc - Sort by vote count (descending)

# Persistence Layer

Using Realm Swift for local storage:
• Async Operations: All database operations are async/await based
• Category-based Caching: Movies are categorized by filter type
• Efficient Queries: Optimized Realm queries for fast retrieval
• Automatic Updates: update: .all policy for seamless data updates
